# Final Project Probabilisitc Programming

This is the final project repository template for
[Machine Learning with Probabilistic Programming](http://www.proditus.com/mlpp2019).

We aim to use a model similar to Gaussian Process/Kernel regression to determine the impact of farms on the level of groundwater.  We use a spatial-temporal model to determine the impact of classified farmland pixels from satellite imagery on specific wells' times series. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to draw samples from our posterior and a random forest with convolutions in Google Earth Engine to classify farmland.
